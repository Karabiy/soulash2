	"description": "Significantly enhances all racial weaponsmiths by adding essential basic weapons (knives, hammers, darts, brass knuckles) to every faction while preserving their unique specializations. Each weaponsmith now knows 26-38 different weapons instead of the original 4-30, making them much more useful and versatile. Mushman weaponsmiths are greatly improved from 4 to 26 recipes. BEST USED WITH NEW GAMES: NPCs gain recipes based on skill-level milestones - existing high-level NPCs may miss some basic recipes, but new weaponsmiths will get the full enhanced skillset.",
