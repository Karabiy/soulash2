	"description": "Significantly enhances all racial weaponsmiths with expanded recipe collections while maintaining their cultural specializations. Each weaponsmith now knows 25-38 different weapons instead of the original 4-30, making them much more useful and versatile. BEST USED WITH NEW GAMES: NPCs gain recipes on achievement of particular skill-level based milestones based on their occupation and current level - existing high-level NPCs may miss some recipes, but new weaponsmiths will get the full enhanced skillset.",
