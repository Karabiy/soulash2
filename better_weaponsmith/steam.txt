[h1]Important Notes for Existing Saves[/h1]
NPCs in Soulash 2 learn recipes based on their level. They [b]do NOT[/b] go back to learn low-level recipes they missed.
[list]
[*] [b]What this means:[/b] High-level smiths in an existing save will miss the new low-level recipes from this mod. Only newly spawned smiths will have the complete, correct list.
[*] [b]Solution:[/b] Start a new game to ensure all weaponsmiths have their full, enhanced recipe collection from level 1 or continue your current game, so that new Weaponsmiths will gain all the new recipes available.
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Requires:[/b] Core_2 mod.
[*] [b]Overwrites:[/b] The specific weaponsmith entities for each race.
[*] [b]Compatible:[/b] Should work with most other mods that do not edit the same entities.
