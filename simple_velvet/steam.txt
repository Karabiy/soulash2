[h1]Simple Velvet Crafting[/h1]

Tired of hunting for spiders just to craft Velvet? This is especially tedious on your second or third character. This simple quality-of-life mod makes Velvet much more accessible.

It replaces the original crafting recipe, allowing you to use common Silk instead of rare Spider's Silk.
